1. you may want to change some paths in 

cube666/CMakeLists.txt  

and in 


cube666/include/preparation.hh  (search for _HOME_ in there.)

before running. (you can search for "sdiluise" to see which paths need to be changed.)




2. there are 2 convenient scripts for rebuilding / relinking (e.g. after adding a new class) :

rebuild.sh
relink.sh

you just have to source (one of ) them . After changing the paths in the cmake file, you can source the rebuild.sh script and it will rebuild and compile for you.




3. to compile :

cd cube666_build
gmake -j4




4. to run :

cd cube666_build
./Cube666 0 run.mac


the 1st argument governs the visualization, 1 = visualization on, 0 = vis. off.
you can change the run.mac macro to change the particle you emit or change the position, volume, surface, â€¦. where they are emitted.



5. You will also have to set the environment variables pointing to the data files, otherwise it may complain. following is a snippet of G4 env. variables from my home on the brutus cluster just to get an idea where the data files may reside :

G4LEVELGAMMADATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/PhotonEvaporation2.3
G4NEUTRONXSDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/G4NEUTRONXS1.2
G4LEDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/G4EMLOW6.32
G4NEUTRONHPDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/G4NDL4.2
G4RADIOACTIVEDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/RadioactiveDecay3.6
G4PIIDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/G4PII1.3
G4SAIDXSDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/G4SAIDDATA1.1
G4REALSURFACEDATA=/cluster/home04/phys/khnguyen/work/geneve/software/geant4/geant4.9.6.p02-install/share/Geant4-9.6.2/data/RealSurface1.0


Setup the environment according to you directory PATHs

This is an example script you can find in cube666_build/ConfigData.sh:

export G4LEDATA=/Users/sdiluise/geant4.10.00.p02-build/data/G4EMLOW6.35
export G4LEVELGAMMADATA=/Users/sdiluise/geant4.10.00.p02-build/data/PhotonEvaporation3.0/
export G4NEUTRONXSDATA=/Users/sdiluise/geant4.10.00.p02-build/data/G4NEUTRONXS1.4/
export G4SAIDXSDATA=/Users/sdiluise/geant4.10.00.p02-build/data/G4SAIDDATA1.1/
export G4NEUTRONHPDATA=/Users/sdiluise/geant4.10.00.p02-build/data/G4NDL4.4/
